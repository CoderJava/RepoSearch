## Content
The purpose of this repo:
  1. Check wheter internet connection is available or not.
  2. To share and teach how to fetch data from internet using
asyntask, volley, okhttp and retrofit.

## Courtesy
This sample source from [Ray Wenderlich](https://raywenderlich.com/126770/android-networking-tutorial-getting-started) in 2016. But, because of today is 2017, there's something deprecated in that source. So, I have initiative to modified it.

## Usage
Just switch branch i.e. master > Volley or Volley > OkHttp etc.
